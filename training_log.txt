Protos vs Zerg
Difficulty: 1
100 episodes (1 iter): 98% win

Difficulty: 2
model: latest.3 (based on diff:1 model first)
Finished 2 epocs (200 games) before stuck. Best win rate 77%

Restarting with only 1 process and 2 threads. Added one more synchronizer to make sure all processes/threads start each epoch together. Also gracefully exit after max_iter.

Still have bugs with multiple processes or machine killed it after running out of memory.

Difficulty 3
model: zerg_latest.3 (based on model trained from diff 2)
10/26: 06:33: Running 200 episodes for 10 iterations, with 1 proc, 2 threads.
epoch 0 (): 6% winning rate.
epoch 1: 2.5% winning rate.
epoch 2: 7.5
epoch 3 (12:15): 
23:28 Training finished with 10 whole iterations: max win rate: 26%.
Full 2000 games took about 17 hours.

tensorflow gpu error after 5 iterations, had to restart.
